      <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-light/80">
        Pennine Digital is a small web studio based in West Yorkshire, focused on building clean, modern websites for local businesses. The
        aim is simple: make the web feel less complicated and more helpful.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading">The person behind the work</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-dark/80">
        I’m Chris — a front‑end developer and creative technologist based in Riddlesden. Over the last couple of years, I’ve been learning
        modern development practices, building projects, and shaping a way of working that’s calm, clear, and reliable.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-dark/80">
        Before development, I worked in hospitality, which taught me how to communicate well, stay organised, and look after people
        properly. Those skills matter just as much in web design as the technical ones.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-dark/80">
        Pennine Digital is where those two worlds meet: thoughtful design, modern code, and a friendly, straightforward approach.

      <h2 class="font-heading text-3xl">Why I started Pennine Digital</h2>
      <p class="text-dark/80 mt-4">
        As I learned more about the web, I noticed how many local businesses were stuck between expensive agencies and DIY website builders
        that never quite feel right. I wanted to offer something in the middle — a personal, dependable service that gives people a website
        they can be proud of without the stress.
      </p>
      <p class="text-dark/80 mt-2">
        Pennine Digital is my way of doing that. A small studio with a local focus and a simple, honest approach.
