      <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading">The person behind the work</h2>
      <p class="mt-4 text-dark/80">
        I’m Chris — a front‑end developer and creative technologist based in Riddlesden. Over the last couple of years, I’ve been learning
        modern development practices, building projects, and shaping a way of working that’s calm, clear, and reliable.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-dark/80">
        Before development, I worked in hospitality, which taught me how to communicate well, stay organised, and look after people
        properly. Those skills matter just as much in web design as the technical ones.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-dark/80">
        Pennine Digital is where those two worlds meet: thoughtful design, modern code, and a friendly, straightforward approach.
